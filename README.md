# AzureDesignStudio.AzureResources

**AzureDesignStudio.AzureResources** is a side project of [AzureDesignStudio](https://github.com/chunliu/AzureDesignStudio). This project creates a collection of C# class libraries which contain the strong C# types for various of Azure resources. These libraries are used by AzureDesignStudio to serialize and deserialize Azure ARM templates and Bicep easily.

The C# code in this repo is auto-generated from the JSON schema of the ARM template by a tool, [ArmTypeGenerator](https://github.com/chunliu/ArmTypeGenerator), which is another side project of AzureDesignStudio.
Although the libraries are created for AzureDesignStudio, they can be used in other projects as well. If you need to serialize or deserialize ARM template or Bicep with C# in your project, AzureDesignStudio.AzureResources can make your life much easier.

## Features

- Strong C# types for Azure Resources, up to date to the latest ARM template schema.
- Serialize and deserialize with `System.Text.Json` easily.

## How to use it

To use the libraries in your project, you can clone and build the code. But the most simple way is to get the nuget packages of it. For example, you can add types for Microsoft.Network resources by installing the package:

```csharp
Install-Package AzureDesignStudio.AzureResources.Network -Version 0.3.0
```

To create an ARM template with code, you can do the following. You can find more samples in the [samples](/samples/) folder.

```csharp
VirtualNetworks vnet = new()
{
    Name = "Hello-vnet",
    Location = "eastus",
    Properties = new()
    {
        AddressSpace = new()
        {
            AddressPrefixes = new List<string> { "10.0.0.0/16" }
        }
    }
};

VirtualNetworksSubnets subnet = new()
{
    Name = $"{vnet.Name}/subnet1",
    Properties = new()
    {
        AddressPrefix = "10.0.0.0/24"
    },
};

DeploymentTemplate deploymentTemplate = new()
{
    Schema = "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    ContentVersion = "1.0.0.0",
    Resources = new List<ResourceBase> { vnet, subnet }
};

var template = JsonSerializer.Serialize(deploymentTemplate,
    new JsonSerializerOptions(JsonSerializerDefaults.Web)
    {
        DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingDefault,
        Encoder = JavaScriptEncoder.UnsafeRelaxedJsonEscaping,
        WriteIndented = true,
        Converters = { new ResourceBaseJsonConverter() }
    });

Console.Write(template);
```

## Contributions

Since the code is auto generated by a tool, manual editing would not be accepted. But if you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to create an issue. I will see if it can be addressed by the tool or not.
